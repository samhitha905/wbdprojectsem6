When they do find the time to write them, they often don't really know what to write, and their blog gets populated by unread and quite often unreadable posts. These posts don't provide the customer with any real content or value, and because they generate no visitor interest, they get ignored by Google.\n\nThis is where you come in.\n\nEven if you've never written a blog post before, you have one very big advantage over the business owner: you are a writer.
